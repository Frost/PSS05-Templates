PSS 05 TEMPLATES

PSS 05 templates for use in the Software Development course at KTH.


REQUIREMENTS

In order to build these templates, you'll need some way of building .tex files, as well as gnumake (if you want to be able to use the Makefiles).

Personally, I prefer XeTeX for building the PDFs, since it's quite nice to work with, and doesn't have many of the problems LaTeX has with unicode. 

If you don't like XeTeX, or don't want to use it for some reason, ordinary LaTeX (the latex or pdflatex commands) will work just fine. However, if you need to input any unicode characters, you might want to uncomment line 4 in lib/includes.tex in order to be able to view those characters properly.

If you want to switch between the pdflatex and xelatex commands, you can do so in lib/Makefile.in. 


WRITING A DOCUMENT

I've written a lot of TODOs in the files in the project. They're actually not for me but for you. Fill in whatever it says you're supposed to fill in there, and you'll be fine.

Basically, the process of writing a document is about filling out the different sections required in the document.

The .tex-files for these sections can be found in the $whatever_document_you_are_writing/sections/ directory and are named descriptively. If you look at $whatever_document_you_are_writing/$whatever_document_you_are_writing.tex, you can see a list of what sections are available, and what they will be called in the actual documnet.

Meeting minutes are a part of these documents (at least in the software engineering course at KTH). My build script will automatically include any minutes in pdf format placed in the $whatever_document_you_are_writing/appendices/minutes/ directory.

BUILDING A DOCUMENT

In order to build a specific document (for example ppd.pdf), simply position yourself in the root directory and type one of these lines (they are identical):

$ make ppd
$ make ppd.pdf

The generated file will then be available in the ppd directory, named ppd.pdf.

If you want to build ppd.dvi, you instead type:

$ make ppd.dvi

Should you want to build all documents at the same time, you can simply write one of these lines:

$ make
$ make pdf
$ make dvi

The two first lines will build pdf versions of the document, whereas the last one will build a dvi version.
